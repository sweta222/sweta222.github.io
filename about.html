             Hi everyone,,so basically its my first own game design,,a very basic game that could be very useful for the beginners to this field..
             In this page,,you can play this snake game very easily i.e its designed for a single user only..
             whenever the snake eats food,,its size is increased and at last you can check your score on the left corner of the game area..
             when the snake increases its size atmost a point where further eating couldn't be possible,,in that particular condition,,the game is over which's displayed on the scrren..
